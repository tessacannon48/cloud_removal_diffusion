# Cloud Removal from Sentinel-2 Imagery using Conditional Diffusion Models

## About The Project

### Goal
The goal of this project is to **remove clouds from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery** using a **Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** with a shallow UNet architecture. The model is trained to reconstruct cloud-free scenes conditioned on their cloudy counterparts.

### Motivation
Clouds obscure satellite observations, impeding reliable analysis for remote sensing applications such as climate monitoring, land use classification, and Arctic navigation. By generating synthetic cloud-free imagery, this project helps improve data availability in frequently cloud-covered regions, with a specific focus on **North Slope, Alaska**—a relatively stable Arctic region during late spring.

## Data Source

**Notebook:** `/Cloud Removal Project/data_retrieval.ipynb`  
**Provider:** [ESA Copernicus Data Space](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/)

- **Region:** North Slope, Alaska  
- **Bounding Polygon:**  
  `(-162.0 68.5, -162.0 71.5, -140.0 71.5, -140.0 68.5, -162.0 68.5)`
- **Time Window:**
  - **Clear Images:** March 1–30, 2024 (≤1% cloud coverage)
  - **Cloudy Images:** February 1–April 30, 2024 (5–50% cloud coverage)

Image pairs are matched by:
- Same geographic area
- Temporal proximity (±30 days)
- Preference for closest match if multiple options exist

Out of 29 initial matches, **13 pairs** were retained after manual visual inspection to ensure cloud validity and landscape consistency.

## Dataset Construction

**Notebook:** `/Cloud Removal Project/dataset_creation.ipynb`

1. **Patch Extraction:**
   - Cloudy images are segmented using a 256×256 sliding window.
   - Selected only those patches where **cloud coverage is 5–30%**, ensuring good coverage and variability for learning.

2. **Output:**
   - 37,661 patch pairs, each with:
     - A cloudy image patch
     - A corresponding clear image patch
     - A cloud mask patch
   - Stored in:
     - `temp/cloudy_patches/`
     - `temp/clear_patches/`
     - `temp/mask_patches/`

## Modelling

**Notebook:** `/Cloud Removal Project/model_development.ipynb`  
**Model:** Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)  
**Architecture:** Lightweight UNet

### Architecture Details
- **Conditioning Input:** Cloudy image patch
- **Target Output:** Cloud-free image patch
- **Downsampling:** 2 layers via MaxPooling
- **Upsampling:** 2 layers via Transposed Convolution
- **Blocks:** Double convolution layers (GELU + GroupNorm)
- **Timestep Encoding:** Sinusoidal embedding
- **Loss Function:** MSE weighted by the cloud mask (to focus reconstruction on cloud-covered areas)

### Training Configuration
- Epochs: 5  
- Batch Size: 8  
- Diffusion Timesteps: 1000  
- Learning Rate: `1e-4`  
- Evaluation Metrics (on samples):  
  - Visual inspection  
  - SSIM  
  - PSNR

## Limitations

### Data Limitations
- **Clear ≠ Ground Truth:** Lighting conditions vary due to clouds, so even cloud-free images don’t perfectly match the same scene under cloud cover.
- **Thin Cloud Ambiguity:** Thin clouds are hard to visually identify, particularly when downsampled into 256×256 patches.
- **Label Quality:** ESA’s cloud masks have some inaccuracies.
- **Limited Pairs:** Only 13 image pairs met the strict requirements of geographic and temporal similarity.

### Computational Constraints
- A **shallow model** was used to control training time and GPU memory.
- **Epochs and architecture depth** were limited to reduce resource usage, likely sacrificing reconstruction fidelity.

## Future Work

- Integrate radiometric correction or SAR data to reduce lighting inconsistencies.
- Develop better cloud mask labeling methods or integrate human-in-the-loop annotation.
- Experiment with deeper, more expressive UNet backbones if computational resources allow.
- Explore temporal modeling (e.g., clear image before/after) to improve predictions.
- Expand dataset geographically and temporally for greater generalization.
